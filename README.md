# practice-Julia
This is a program for trying out Julia.
I made a simple program to plot a sin wave and a sin^2 wave and merged it into the main branch using a series of commit push pull and merge commands.
Next I have to figure out how to do it again so that I can tell a collaborator how to work on my program.
